This page lists known issues that cannot be fixed by the plugin code but rather depend on browser or operating system specific issues.

## Mozilla Firefox + GNU/Linux file managers

If you are using linux and firefox, file drag&drop upload won't work with some file managers. I have tested with thunar, pcmanfm and ROX. Nautilus seems to work though.

Chrome works fine with these file managers though.
