## Mozilla Firefox + GNU/Linux file managers

If you are using linux and firefox, file drag&drop upload won't work with some file managers. I have tested with thunar, pcmanfm and ROX. Nautilus seems to work though.

If you want all the details, [[have a look here|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=609284]]

Chrome works fine with these file managers though.
