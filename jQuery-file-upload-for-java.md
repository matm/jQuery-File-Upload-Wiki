**Note:**
This tutorial is for the outdated [v4 branch](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/tree/v4) of the plugin.
User contributions for an updated example are welcome.

Here is a sample application that demonstrates how the file upload via this plugin can be posted to a Java servlet and processed on the backend.

It is an eclipse dynamic web project. After you check it out you may have to fiddle with the build path to point it to your installed servlet runtime. I used tomcat 6.
