```

### Differences in upload progress events
Depending on the size of the file, the operating system platform and the network throughput, the number of progress events triggered might differ.  
e.g. Google Chrome might only trigger one progress event for the upload of a 100KB file on Windows XP, but trigger multiple progress events for the same file on Windows 7 and Mac OSX (tested with Google Chrome version 22.0.1229.94).
