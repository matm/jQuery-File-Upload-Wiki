First of all, I am sorry for my english.
I preapared a classic asp version of this good project.

I design for pictures only (50kb - 3MB limitation), 
but if you want, you can change and use for all files.

I use ASPUpload & ASPJpeg components in this version.
All images resizes by ASPJpeg and after that save.

It also have got a access database inside which keep all files name,size and addDate inside it.
I use database for show a sample functional usage.

It also need to Scripting.FileSystemObject (FSO Object) to can DELETE files. (and also need to learn new resized pictures data size)

Upload.asp page have got a small configration settings on the top.  - Dont forget that.

**Upload.asp page is ENGLISH**
**Index.asp page is Turkish** but index is not important.


I hope you Enjoy.... Links life 4 years until today.
