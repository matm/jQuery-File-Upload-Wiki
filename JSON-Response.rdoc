The following is the response from the server for the file upload plugin
```javascript
[
  {
    url: "http://url.to/file/or/page",
    thumbnail_url: "http://url.to/thumnail.jpg ",
    name: "thumb2.jpg",
    type: "image/jpeg",
    size: 46353,
    delete_url: "http://url.to/delete /file/",
    delete_type: "DELETE"
  }
]
```

This json can be used to show the images during the initial loading of the plugin to show list of images.
