**Note:**
This tutorial is for the outdated [v4 branch](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/tree/v4) of the plugin.
User contributions for an updated example are welcome.

This is an C# Forms example of jQuery File Upload.  The project includes a file upload handler (ashx) page that accepts a file and writes it to a directory on the webserver.  It also logs the request to a log file.

The only changes to the jQuery-File-Upload zip file is to the CSS file to allow the jQuery to work better with other controls on the page.
