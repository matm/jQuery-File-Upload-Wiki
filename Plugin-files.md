## JavaScript files
* [jquery.fileupload.js](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload.js) is the basic plugin - it enhances the file upload process, but doesn't make any assumptions about the user interface or the content-type of the response.
* [jquery.fileupload-ui.js](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload-ui.js) is an extension to *jquery.fileupload.js*. The UI version expects JSON as the response content and adds some user interface methods, but doesn't provide any HTML content itself.
* [example/jquery.fileupload-uix.js](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/example/jquery.fileupload-uix.js) is an extension to *jquery.fileupload-ui.js* and a full implementation example.
* [example/application.js](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/example/application.js) is an example how to initialize and use *example/jquery.fileupload-uix.js*.
* [tests/tests.js](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/tests/tests.js) contains code for the unit tests.
